The stemmer provides the stem of an input pali word. 

It involves a few steps. 

The word class (noun, verb, adj....) of the input word is checked first.
The same word may belong to multiple word classes.
Hence a list of possibilities is returned. 

If no possibilities are identified, the ending of given word is compared with all 
available word endings and if matched, it is removed. This process is carried 
out recursively. 

If word class is identified, we consider each word class separately. 
Lists of endings for each word class are generated separately, and those endings
are compared with the word. If matching, the word is stemmed.
A list of possible stems is returned. Mostly, each separate case returns the same
stem. This method improves accuracy of stemming.
